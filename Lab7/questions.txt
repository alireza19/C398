1. there are numInputs of threads * each thread has lg(blockInputs). Thus there are numInputs*lg(blockSize) floating 
point opr's.

2. accessing and reading numInputs number of global memory reads.

3. there are numInputs / blockSize writes.

4. a single thread block syncs lg(blockSize) to reduce.
